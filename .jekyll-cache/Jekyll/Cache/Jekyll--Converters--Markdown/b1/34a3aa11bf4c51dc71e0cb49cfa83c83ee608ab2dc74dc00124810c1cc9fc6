I"œ<p>I graduated from UMass Amherst with a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics where I also completed REUs in a span of fields from logic debugging and eigensolvers all the way to analysis on hyperspectral imageing. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Researcher at Systems and Technology Research, a medium-sized defense contractor. In my free time Iâ€™m usually working on some project to help me get a hands on perspective of the pros/cons of whatever model Iâ€™m replicating/extending. Because of this, a friend recently mentioned I should start a blog and here I am :). I also sprinkle in some research focused ideas as well.</p>

<p>The goal is to hopefully push a project at least once every one or two weeks, so if you see me slacking feel free to give me hell :P.</p>
